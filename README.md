2. **Psychtoolbox**

## Description
This _practice_ experiment is intended for those with a basic knowledge of MATLAB that hope to grasp the essentials of a running a simple perceptual experiment employing Psychtoolbox.

_Clone_ the repository and have a play, if you make some cool updates to the task (perhaps some analysis scripts or extended, helpful comments) open a pull request and we might just add it to the 'master'!

The critical m-file for running the experiment is in the scripts subfolder: [**practice_runExp.m**](./scripts/)
